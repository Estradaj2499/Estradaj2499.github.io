### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was my favorite because we were able to calculate the area of a rectangle with a function and turning strings to integers. I liked how we made the arguments only two and if it was more than we would show an error. I also liked how we had to edit another file just to get the actual function to work.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was my favorite because I really enjoyed learning about how the arguments worked. I found it interesting that when you start an argument that you must start with 0. I also really liked the wide variety of answer choices you can give now with arguments.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was one of my favorites because I learned how to check for lint making sure everything worked right. This made me learn how the files are supposed to look and showed me if I was learning the right way. I really like how using this from the very beginning stuck with me the entire time and I never forgot, and I still used it to this day.
